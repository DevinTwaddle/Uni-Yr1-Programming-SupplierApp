# Uni-Yr1-Programming-SupplierApp
This application was created in JAVA, during my first year of university for an Assessment.
The goal was to create a console-based application which would essentially function as an interface between a user, and a database system.
It should be noted that in this case, the database system in question is merely being emulated, with the main focus being placed upon the interface.
As may be seen, the program is seperated into two parts. This was merely to line up with general requirements.

  [Part1:]
    This section was used to outline basic, yet required functionality. Essentailly operating as a base, for part 2.
  [Part2:]
		Here, I implimented additional features to accommodate new operations, regarding the addition, deletion or modifcation of information. In addition to this, I made modifications to blocks of code and general concepts, as to improve overall useability, making the program increasingly userfriendly.
	
Though not relevant to the program in question, I would simply add that I greatly enjoyed creating this application.
It was the first proper program which I create in JAVA, and offered a fair bit of flexability within the requirements, which allowed me to experiment with ways in which I could code functionality, and display information.
		It also provided an opprotunity to refine not only my skills, but different practices. This relating to the refining of my code, testing, and the structuring of a program.
